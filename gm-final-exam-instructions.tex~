\textbf{Final Exam Instructions}

Here are the types of questions you can expect for the final exam.

\begin{itemize}
\item Solve any of the following equations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item linear (or systems of linear equations)
  \item quadratic
  \item exponential
  \item logarithmic
  \item trigonometric
  \end{itemize}
\item Calculate slopes and $y$-intercepts of linear equations. Draw
  diagrams of linear equations.
\item Solve any plane or spherical triangle.
\item Simplify algebraic expressions, especially radicals, exponents,
  logarithms, and using factoring. Algebraic expressions are
  expressions containing variables such as $x,y$, etc.
\item Identify conic sections and calculate their features from a
  given equation.
\item Use vectors to find bearings/angles and lengths in coordinate
  systems or for force problems.
\item Solve word problems involving the normal distribution or the
  approximation of the binomial distribution by the normal
  distribution.
\item Solve word problems using any of the methods in this list.
\end{itemize}

(1) A student needs a certain grade to advance to the next step. Long
years of experience have shown that the probability of advancing is 3
in 5. What is the probability that only half or less of this year's
class of 22 students advance?

(2) 39.5\% of Canadians voted for the Liberals in the last election.
What is the probability that a random sample of 50 Canadians contains
18--22 people who voted for the Liberals?

(3) The amount of sugar in a 10kg bag is normally distributed. The
mean is $\mu=10.09$kg; the standard deviation is $\sigma=0.045$kg.
What percentage of 10kg bags contains less than 10kg?

(4) Warranty issues for a refrigerator arise after a certain number of
days which is normally distributed. The mean is $\mu=432$ days; the
standard deviation is $\sigma=47$ days. If the warranty covers the
cost of a repair within $365$ days, what is the percentage of warranty
issues that the company providing the warranty has to cover?

(5) How many people with an IQ of over 140 would you expect to live in
Canada? Use a normal distribution with mean $\mu=100$, standard
deviation $\sigma=15$, and 36.3 million for Canada's population.

(6) Santiago in Chile (longitude $70^{\circ}$W) and Sydney in
Australia (longitude $151^{\circ}$E) both have a latitude of
$33^{\circ}$S. How far apart are they along a great circle? Use
Napier's miraculous pentagram.

(7) Santa lives near Resolute Bay in Nunavut at $74^{\circ}42'$N,
$94^{\circ}50'$W. His reindeer go to London, England, roughly
south-east, covering a distance of 4687km. Santa goes roughly
south-west at an exact right angle to where the reindeer went. He
covers a distance of 3000km. How far is he from London?

(8) Solve the following right triangles for the side or angle
specified. $C$ is the right angle.

(a) $a=16^{\circ}13',b=59^{\circ}7'$ find angle $A$

(b) $c=107^{\circ}13',A=63^{\circ}14'$ find side $b$

(c) $A=135^{\circ}27'15'',B=82^{\circ}21'30''$ find side $a$

(d) $b=0.7089,B=1.1781$ find angle $A$

(9) Find the shortest distance between the following cities along the
great circle.

(a) Vancouver ($49^{\circ}15'$N, $123^{\circ}6'$W) and Taipei City
($25^{\circ}2'$N, $121^{\circ}38'$E)

(b) Vancouver ($49^{\circ}15'$N, $123^{\circ}6'$W) and Rio de Janeiro
($22^{\circ}54'$S, $43^{\circ}12'$W)

(c) Lom{\'e} ($6^{\circ}8'$N, $1^{\circ}13'$E) and Hanoi
($21^{\circ}2'$N, $105^{\circ}51'$E)

(10) Find the distance, the initial course, and the final course in
traveling from the first city listed in each problem below to the
second.

(a) San Francisco ($37^{\circ}47'$N, $122^{\circ}26'$W) and Honolulu
($21^{\circ}18'$N, $157^{\circ}52'$W)

(b) Melbourne ($37^{\circ}50'$S, $144^{\circ}59'$E) and Quito
($0^{\circ}14'$S, $78^{\circ}30'$W)

(c) Moscow ($55^{\circ}45'$N, $37^{\circ}34'$E) and New York
($40^{\circ}49'$N, $73^{\circ}57'$W)

(10) Solve the following triangles. 

(a) $a=38^{\circ},b=45^{\circ},B=65^{\circ}$

(b) $B=110^{\circ}10',C=132^{\circ}59',b=146^{\circ}6'$

(c) $a=\frac{13\pi}{36},b=\frac{7\pi}{9},c=\frac{11\pi}{18}$

(d) $A=126^{\circ}14',B=115^{\circ}37',c=43^{\circ}15'$

(e) $A=128^{\circ}19',B=112^{\circ}13',C=78^{\circ}14'$

(11) The spherical triangle lies on the sphere with radius $R$. Find
the length of $a$, not represented as an angle.

(a) $A=60^{\circ},B=70^{\circ},C=100^{\circ},R=90$

(b) $A=31^{\circ}5',b=78^{\circ}10',c=91^{\circ}7',R=24.2$
