\textbf{Final Exam}

Show all of your work. Correct answers without showing how to get them
does not earn you points.

\textbf{There are TWO pages and NINE questions.} The maximum number of
points is 100.

({\frage}) Solve the logarithmic equation. Do not use a calculator for your
calculation. It's OK to use a calculator to check your answer. [9]
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vuomebic}
  \log_{2}x-\log_{2}\frac{1}{4}=3
\end{equation}

The solution set is $S=\{2\}$.

({\frage}) Solve the trigonometric equation in $\{x\in\mathbb{R}|0^{\circ}\leq{}x<360^{\circ}\}$. [12]
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:waibohng}
  5\cos^{2}x=4\sin{}x+4
\end{equation}

$0.20136=11.537^{\circ}$

({\frage}) Solve the following system of equations by any method. [9]
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tiwiehai}
  \begin{array}{rcccl}
    x&+&\frac{1}{5}y&=&\frac{4}{3} \\
    3x&-&2y&=&-9
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

({\frage}) A surveyor measures an angle at $53^{\circ}16'26''$. She
knows from long experience that the true angle (as opposed to her
measurement) is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of
$53^{\circ}16'26''$ and a standard deviation of $1'13''$. What is the
probability that the true angle is between $53^{\circ}16'$ and
$15^{\circ}17'$? [12]

({\frage}) Vancouver is at $49^{\circ}15'N,123^{\circ}6'E$. Osaka in
Japan is at $34^{\circ}42'N,135^{\circ}30'E$. Honolulu on Hawaii is at
$21^{\circ}18'N,157^{\circ}49'W$. Two airplanes leave from Vancouver
to go to their respective destinations, Osaka and Honolulu, along a
great circle. What is the angle between the routes of the two
airplanes as they leave Vancouver? [12]

({\frage}) Solve the exponential equation. Do not use a calculator for your
calculation. It's OK to use a calculator to check your answer. [10]

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vaiphook}
  3^{x-1}=e^{3x}  
\end{equation}

({\frage}) The points $A$ and $B$ in the figure are on opposite sides
of the river and inaccessible from points $x$ and $y$. Find the
distance $AB$ from the survey notes. [12]

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}\hline
  distance from $x$ to $y$ & 450ft \\ \hline
  angle at $x$ for triangle $Axy$ & 129$^{\circ}$ \\ \hline
  angle at $y$ for triangle $Ayx$ & 32$^{\circ}$ \\ \hline
  angle at $x$ for triangle $Bxy$ & 43$^{\circ}$ \\ \hline
  angle at $y$ for triangle $Byx$ & 113$^{\circ}$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

({\frage}) Solve the following right spherical triangle with a right angle at
$A$. [12]
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eichaech}
  b=56^{\circ}21'30'',B=59^{\circ}15'32''
\end{equation}

({\frage}) According to 2010 census data, the ratio of men to women
among centenarians is $1:4$ (i.e.\ 20\% of centenarians are men). Use
normal approximation of the binomial distribution to calculate the
probability that out of 50 centenarians 12 or more are male. [12]
